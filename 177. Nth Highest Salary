CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N IN NUMBER) RETURN NUMBER IS

BEGIN
      select distinct Salary
      into result
      from(
      select Salary,
      dense_rank() over(order by Salary DESC) as rk

      RETURN result;
END;

```
Explaination
First is about DENSE_RANK and rank and row_number()
rank() will return something like 1,1,1,4,4,5
dense_rank() will return something like 1,1,1,2,2,3
row_number() will return 1,2,3,4,5,6

here we use dense_rank() since we need to contious NUMBER

Second thing is about distinct,
it is possible that after we do rank(), there are muiltiple rows
will have the same rank() result, so we need to add distinct!
at the select statement, make sure only return one row

Third thing is about ORDER BY salary DESC NULLS LAST
here NULL LAST means that if the ordered columns include null,
how to order NULL value. Other value:
NULL LAST, NULL FIRST

The last thing is about function in Oracle:
pay attetion to the select ... into ; and return style
