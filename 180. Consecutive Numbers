/* Write your PL/SQL query statement below */

select distinct Num as ConsecutiveNums from
(select a.*, b.Num as num2, c.Num as num3
from Logs a
left join Logs b
on a.Id = b.Id+1
left join Logs c
on a.Id = c.Id+2)
where Num = num2
and num2 = num3;

-- Explaination:
```do three times of left join, performance not good.```
-- other people use lead, which i do not know:

"""select distinct num as ConsecutiveNums from (
select num,lead(num,1)over(order by id) as sec,lead(num,2)over(order by id)  as thd from logs) a where num = sec and num = thd"""

-- lead means move one cell up, lead(colums_name, num_of_cell to move_up) over(order by <order>)
-- the smae as lag(), but lag do shift one cell below, lag(columns_nume, num_of_cell_to_move_down) over (order by <order>)
